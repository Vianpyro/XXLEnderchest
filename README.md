## ✨ Features

| Rows | Slots | Use case |
|------|-------|----------|
| 3 | 27 | Vanilla default, always available to everyone |
| 4 | 36 | Extra storage for selected players or groups |
| 5 | 45 | Mid-tier storage upgrade |
| 6 | 54 | Maximum XXL storage |

- Vanilla access is preserved: every player can always use a normal 3-row ender chest.
- Fixed config mode for simple servers or single-player worlds.
- Optional LuckPerms mode for per-group row upgrades.
- Optional Mod Menu + Cloth Config integration for an in-game config screen on the client.
- Optional /enderchest command, it opens the player's own enderchest.
- Automatic fallback to config mode if LuckPerms is enabled in config but the mod is not installed.
- Hidden rows keep their items stored safely; lowering access does not delete inventory contents.
- Works on dedicated servers and in single-player.

## ❗ How it works

XXL Enderchest always keeps the internal enderchest container at 54 slots so data is never thrown away.

What players can actually open depends on the active mode:

- `enabled=false`: vanilla behavior only, 3 rows.
- `enabled=true` and `useLuckPerms=false`: everyone gets the configured `rows` value.
- `enabled=true` and `useLuckPerms=true` with LuckPerms installed: everyone keeps vanilla 3 rows by default, and permissions can upgrade that to 4, 5, or 6 rows.
- `enabled=true` and `useLuckPerms=true` without LuckPerms installed: automatic fallback to configured `rows`.
- `commandEnabled=true`: players can use `/enderchest`; in LuckPerms mode they also need the command permission node.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Config file: `config/xxlenderchest.json`

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "useLuckPerms": false,
  "rows": 6,
  "commandEnabled": false
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | When `false`, the mod stays inactive and the ender chest remains vanilla. |
| `useLuckPerms` | boolean | When `true`, XXL Enderchest checks LuckPerms row nodes if LuckPerms is installed. |
| `rows` | integer | Fallback row count from `3` to `6`. Used when LuckPerms mode is off, or when LuckPerms is missing. |
| `commandEnabled` | boolean | Enables `/enderchest`. Default is `false`. In LuckPerms mode, players also need the command node. |

After editing the config, run `/xxlenderchest reload`.

If you install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) on the client, XXL Enderchest exposes a full config screen in-game.

## 🔄 LuckPerms permissions

There is intentionally no `use` permission.
Every player must always be able to open a vanilla 3-row ender chest.

If LuckPerms mode is active, these nodes can increase the available rows:

- `xxlenderchest.rows.4`
- `xxlenderchest.rows.5`
- `xxlenderchest.rows.6`
- `xxlenderchest.command.enderchest` for `/enderchest` when `commandEnabled=true`

Highest granted row wins.

### LuckPerms quick start

Example: default users get 4 rows, moderators get 5 rows, VIPs get 6 rows.

```text
/lp group default permission set xxlenderchest.rows.4 true
/lp group moderator permission set xxlenderchest.rows.5 true
/lp group vip permission set xxlenderchest.rows.6 true
```

Example: give one player full 6-row access.

```text
/lp user <player> permission set xxlenderchest.rows.6 true
```

Example: enable the `/enderchest` command for one player.

```text
/lp user <player> permission set xxlenderchest.command.enderchest true
```

## 🔄 Commands

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `/enderchest` | Config toggle, plus `xxlenderchest.command.enderchest` when LuckPerms mode is active | Opens the player's own ender chest. Uses vanilla 3 rows when the XXL storage feature is disabled. |
| `/xxlenderchest info` | OP | Shows mod status, whether LuckPerms is loaded, and whether row access currently uses config mode or LuckPerms mode. |
| `/xxlenderchest reload` | OP | Reloads `config/xxlenderchest.json` without restarting the server. |

## ❗ Important notes

### Lowering row access

If a player had access to more rows before, the extra items remain stored.
They are simply hidden until that player regains enough rows again.

### Removing the mod

Vanilla Minecraft only uses the first 27 ender chest slots.
If you remove XXL Enderchest from an existing world, items stored below the first 3 rows may no longer be accessible.
Make a backup before removing the mod from a world or server.
